intro: |
  I am a statistician, educator and researcher. 
  
  My interests are in the development, application and teaching of novel statistical tools to solve challenging real-world problems. I particularly enjoy working on problems with strong ties to environmental and industrial application areas.
  
  If you have a project in mind and would like to work together, then please get in touch via my contact form.

  You can learn more about my teaching, research and other activities on the relevant pages of this website.
