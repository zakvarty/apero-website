## Teaching Experience 

I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to teach in a variety of roles. These have included:

- one-to-one tuition for high school students;
- running workshops and computer labs for undergraduate and postgraduate modules;
- delivering short courses on scientific communication and LaTeX;
- cross-specialisation teaching of data ethics to chemistry research students;
- supervising undergraduate and postgraduate research projects; 
- lecturing postgraduate modules in statistics and data science.

I am an associate fellow of the Higher Education Academy, which you can learn more about [here](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship)). I am currently working toward full fellowship to further develop my teaching practice.
